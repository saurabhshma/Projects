#Homework1

The following code creates 2 processes i.e. client and echo, in which, client program sends packet to echo and echo decrements the Reflection count value in the packet sent and send it back to the client process. The value of reflection count must be even non-negative integer. The process continues until client founds out whether the value of Reflection Count in the packet is 0 or not.

#Execution:
```
1) make
```
```
2) Run echo before the client program (use 'echo -h' for usage)
```
```
3) Run client (use 'client -h' for usage)
```
