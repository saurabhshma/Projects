1. The Python script (stopword_stem.py) does stemming and stopword removal to generate the new train and test files in the same directory.

2. To run script.py, you will need to install some necessary Python packages:

 a. For linux based systems, makefile(make.sh) installs required packages, including nltk (which does the stemming and stop words removal).

 b. For mac, a script similar to make.sh should work. 

 c. For windows, follow the instructions from: http://www.nltk.org/install.html

Let us know if you run into problems installing these packages.

3. You should install the relevant packages first. On successful installation, run the Python script to generate the processed data.
